# [Project 2:A semi-Automated Students' Report Generator](https://github.com/nobeardguy/StudentAutomaticReportGeneration)
I was trying to ease the work done by teachers who have to generate examination results for learners. Sometimes, 
the number of learners might be too large to be done manually. 
- Data used was from students in a CBE class in Garissa County.
- I used Microsoft Excel and Microsoft Word to complete the project.
